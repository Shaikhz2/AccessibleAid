In order to utilize the application, the main directions are to be signed into an account. For testing purposes an account was created with username: test@gmail.com and password: password. This application can be used on any device which can access the internet and can input the application link which is http://csc415-server18.hpc.tcnj.edu:3000/, however, it is optimized for desktop view. 


Functionality I was not able to achieve: Unfortunately, the one functionality I was unable to add was an extra text field which would allow users to go into more detail about what kind of assistance they require for the specific inquiry type they generated.
